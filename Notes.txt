The idea is that anonsays.js will store current subreddit on each reddit page visited, in its own variable.

When a user clicks on a button in the popup, the popup sends a message to the background script, calling for it
to add the current subreddit. The background script will then message the anonsays.js of the active tab, and
request the subreddit it is storing. The anonsays.js will respond with the subreddit name, and the background script can
then update and save it out.

{request: 'current_subreddit'}  from background to get current tab from anonsays.js
                                which will respond with {current_subreddit: '<whatever it happens to be>'}

{action: 'add_current'}         from some script to background to add current tab

{request : 'subscription_list'} from some script to background to return the current subredditNames array
                                which will respond with {subscription_list: '<whatever it happens to be>'}


 // action : "remove_subreddit" : someone wants to remove a subreddit
            // will contain second property subreddit_name

            add_subreddit


            action : 'goto_frontpage'


When a script wants to know the subscription list, they send out a request, and in the response will be the array.



Note that the only functions that directly edit subredditNames are 
updatingSubredditsFromDisk and savingSubredditsToDisk. 
You notice that addSubreddit and removeSubreddit return a temp array.
